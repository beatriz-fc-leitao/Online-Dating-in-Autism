# 💘 Perceptions of Autistic Males' Online Dating Profiles

This project contains an R script and an SPSS script used for data cleaning and analysis of a research project investigating how wording (positive and negative), an explicit label of ASD and stigma impact perceived attractiveness of autistic males' dating profiles.

⚠️ Given that the study used data from human participants, the data is anonymized to ensure confidentiality.

## 🌍 CONTEXT
Due to impairments in social communication and interaction, autistic people have sought relationships through online dating, which alleviates many of these deficits. However, they often face challenges with self presentation on their online dating profile, such as how to word their profile or whether to include a diagnostic label of autism. While wording characteristics positively has shown to increase profile attractiveness, the effect of a diagnostic label of autism is more complex, as it can increase or decrease attractiveness due to its honesty or activation of autism-related stigma respectively.

## 🔬 THE STUDY
This study investigates how positive/negative wording, an explicit autism diagnosis, and high/low stigma affect 187 females’ perceived attractiveness (measured in 3 ways: social attractiveness, physical attractiveness, and task attractiveness), trustworthiness and desirability to date of autistic males’ online dating profiles.

## 💡 FINDINGS
➕ Positive wording increased social and task attractiveness and desirability to date

🏷 A diagnostic label of autism enhanced physical and task attractiveness. A diagnostic label also increased social attractiveness for low-stigma participants and decreased social attractiveness for high-stigma respondents. 

This information can help autistic males construct their online dating profiles in a way that leverages their strengths and therefore allows for them to be perceived as more attractive. The main recommendations that can be made are to include a note mentioning a diagnosis of ASD and to phrase content positively (eg. include "I love a quiet evening at home" instead of "I don't like going out in the evenings"). This could provide crucial social support for the widely reported challenge of self-representation in online dating profiles reported by autistic males.
